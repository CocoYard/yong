I am currently a software engineer at [NIO](https://www.nio.com/), a company focusing on building world-class EV with autonomous-driving technology. My expertise lies in solving geometric problems in HD map reconstruction.

Prior to NIO, I worked at [IDEA](https://www.idea.edu.cn/), where I contributed to the development of a geometric engine for Computer-Aided Design (CAD). During my time there, I focused on solving performance optimization and intersection algorithm challenges, earning top recognition for my contributions.

I hold a Master's degree in computer science from [Washington university in St. Louis](http://wustl.edu), where I conducted a research project under the supervision of [Prof. Tao Ju](https://www.cse.wustl.edu/~taoju/). I am interested in developing algorithms and tools about graphics, visualization products.

I thrive on creative problem-solving, always approaching challenges with an open mind.
