<br>
I am a 2nd year master student at [Washington university in St. Louis](http://wustl.edu) majoring in computer science with an expected graduation date of May 2023. 

Currently I am doing a research project under the supervision of [Prof. Ju](https://www.cse.wustl.edu/~taoju/). I am interested in developing algorithms and tools about graphics, visulization, and application products.

I always enjoy research and creatively solving problems with mathematical thinking. I believe that my experience would help me work as part of a team and effectively serve the industry.
