        - Graded students' assignments based on quality, which were all labs in C++, where I did code reviews and pushed feedbacks to GitHub.
        - Held office hours. Helped students with studio/lab questions by elaborating the reason behind the answer or asking them a similar but easier question to give them an inspiration to the original question.
